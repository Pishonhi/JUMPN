SWIMN is a web 3.0 lifestyle app that implements the swim-to-earn concept. SWIMN is designed to bring happiness back to people through three dimensions: social connections, physical health, and, most importantly, income. Users of SWIMN will gain a high return of $SWN through 'Swimming.' There are several modes, including backstroke mode, breaststroke mode, and extreme sports mode, which contain different rewards levels. 

## MODE

- Freestyle Mode
- Backstroke Mode
- Breaststroke Mode
- Extreme Sports Mode

## Swim To Earn Mechanics

### Key Factors

##### Factors that determine the output of your SWN:

-  Efficiency level of your snorkels, swimfins, or goggles.
-  Frequencies of your movement.
-  Swimming ability.
-  Time you spent.

### Daily Limit

- Backstroke Mode<br>
Time limitation: 4 hours per day
- Breaststroke Mode<br>
Time limitation: 0.5 hours per day
- Freestyle Mode<br>
Calories calculated in 24 hours per day<br>
- Extreme Mode(Coming Soon)

### Earning Mechanics

#### For Backstroke and Breaststroke Mode:

##### _SWN Rewards = N * WAEL*(WABA+ABA)^SWIMN value * α(P1,P2)*F*100_

- N = Number of SET burned.
- WAEL = Weighted average of efficiency level Index.
- WABA = Weighted average of efficiency level.
- ABA = Additional swimming ability.
- F = Ratio of average frequency per minute
- α = Alpha coefficient 
- Parameter: A range of system values.
- SWIMN value: Value set by the team. It changes following the percentage of users engagement. 


#### For Freestyle Mode

- You will get a fixed reward of 10,000 SWN if over 2000 calories are burned per day. 
- If less than 2000 calories burned, SWN Rewards =(Actual Calories you burned - 800)/12*100
  For example, if only 1300 calories are burned today, you will earn (1300-800)/12*100 = 4166.7 SWN as your normal mode reward. 

#### For Extreme Sports Mode (Coming Soon)

Extreme Sports Mode can be used twice per week. You will need to record a video or start a live stream for your challenge. The likes and comments you got and the challenges' difficulties will be directly reflected in the rewards.

## Airdrop

1,294,600,000 SWN (1.2946%) are reserved for airdrop. Early members who finished our airdrop tasks and SWIMN ambassadors will get the airdrop when launched. Please submit the relevant materials to hello@swimn.today to get your airdrop allocation. 

## Anti-Cheating System

Four mechanics are used to stop cheating in the game, which include the cheater's account being punishment:

1. GPS tracking
2. Data edit by coding
3. machine simulation learning through data
4. 24 hours data swimming tracking

Each account must only match one snorkel (SWIMN). If an investor transfer snorkel to another accounting system properly will lock up or burn in the marketplace.
