SWIMN is a web 3.0 lifestyle app that implements the swim-to-earn concept. SWIMN is designed to bring happiness back to people through three dimensions: social connections, physical health, and, most importantly, income. Users of SWIMN will gain a high return of $SWN through 'Swimming.' There are several modes, including backstroke mode, breaststroke mode, and extreme sports mode, which contain different rewards levels. 

## MODE

- Freestyle Mode
- Backstroke Mode
- Breaststroke Mode
- Extreme Sports Mode

## Swim To Earn Mechanics

### Key Factors

##### Factors that determine the output of your SWN:

-  Efficiency level of your snorkels, swimfins, or goggles.
-  Frequencies of your movement.
-  Swimming ability.
-  Time you spent.

### Daily Limit

- Club Mode<br>
Time limitation: 4 hours per day
- Jump Rope Mode<br>
Time limitation: 0.5 hours per day
- Normal Mode<br>
Calories calculated in 24 hours per day<br>
- Extreme Mode(Coming Soon)

### Earning Mechanics

#### For Club and Jump Rope Mode:

##### _JST Rewards = N * WAEL*(WABA+ABA)^JUMPN value * α(P1,P2)*F*100_

- N = Number of JET burned.
- WAEL = Weighted average of efficiency level Index.
- WABA = Weighted average of efficiency level.
- ABA = Additional bounce ability.
- F = Ratio of average frequency per minute
- α = Alpha coefficient 
- Parameter: A range of system values.
- JUMPN value: Value set by the team. It changes following the percentage of users engagement. 


#### For Normal Mode

- You will get a fixed reward of 10,000 JST if over 2000 calories are burned per day. 
- If less than 2000 calories burned, JST Rewards =(Actual Calories you burned - 800)/12*100
  For example, if only 1300 calories are burned today, you will earn (1300-800)/12*100 = 4166.7 JST as your normal mode reward. 

#### For Extreme Sports Mode (Coming Soon)

Extreme Sports Mode can be used twice per week. You will need to record a video or start a live stream for your challenge. The likes and comments you got and the challenges' difficulties will be directly reflected in the rewards.

## Anti-Cheating System

Four mechanics are used to stop cheating in the game, which include the cheater's account being punishment:

1. GPS tracking
2. Data edit by coding

4. 24 hours data jumper tracking

Each account must only match one wristband (JUMPN). If an investor transfer wristband to another accounting system properly will lock up or burn in the marketplace.
